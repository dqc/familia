# Familia

This is an application I created based off of the One Month Rails course (http://onemonthrails.com). I've never done any coding in Ruby or Ruby on Rails, so I decided to get my feet wet and work on a basic application. 

I named my application "Familia" because it allows families or close friends to share memories between each other in one place.
